# Machine Learning Notes

These are my notes about the [Machine Learning course](coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) available in Coursera, given by Professor Andrew Ng. If you're interested in the subject I recommend you to take this course.

It's important to note that you'll not find answers for Quiz or tests here, only my notes that can be (or not) helpful when solving them.

Another point here is that I'm not an expert in ML and my text can have some typos or maybe inconsistences that'll I try to address as soon as possible. If you see something strange open an issue or even make a pull request :-)

Be happy!

# About the notes

The notes are being written in Latex format. I chose this because it's easier to write mathematical stuff. So, you'll need a Latex interpreter installed in you machine to produce some human readable output. It's really easy to find some package for you OS, just Google it.

Another option is to use an online site, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
